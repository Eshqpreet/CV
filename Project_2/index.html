                About Education
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. There are many debates about
                its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to achieve. A further issue is whether
                part of the meaning of education is that some form of improvement took place. Some researchers stress
                the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination. These disagreements affect
                how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The term can also refer to the mental states
                and qualities of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the academic field studying education.

                There are many types of education. Formal education happens in a complex institutional framework, like
                public schools. Non-formal education is also structured but happens outside the formal schooling system.
                Informal education is unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal education
                are divided into levels. They include early childhood education, primary education, secondary education,
                and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the teaching method, like teacher-centered and
                student-centered education. Forms of education can also be distinguished by subject, like science
                education, language education, and physical education.

                Education in India
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education system, which fall under the
                command of the government at three levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of the
                Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and
                compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio
                of the total number of public schools to private schools in India is 10:3.

                Education in India covers different levels and types of learning, such as early childhood education,
                primary education, secondary education, higher education, and vocational education. It varies
                significantly according to different factors, such as location (urban or rural), gender, caste,
                religion, language, and disability.

                Education in India faces many challenges and opportunities, such as improving access and quality,
                reducing disparities and dropouts, increasing enrolment and completion rates, enhancing learning
                outcomes and employability, strengthening governance and accountability, promoting innovation and
                technology, and addressing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. It is influenced by various policies and
                programmes at the national and state levels, such as the National Education Policy 2020, the Samagra
                Shiksha Abhiyan, the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, the Midday Meal Scheme, the Beti Bachao Beti
                Padhao Scheme, and the National Digital Education Architecture. It is also supported by various
                stakeholders and partners, such as UNICEF, UNESCO, World Bank, civil society organizations, academic
                institutions, private sector entities, and media outlets.

                Education system
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Up until 1976, under the Indian constitution, school education was a state subject; states possessed
                full jurisdiction over making and implementing education policies. After the 42nd Amendment of the
                Constitution of India was passed in 1976, education fell under the concurrent list.This allowed the
                central government to recommend education policies and programmes, even if state governments continued
                to wield extensive autonomy in implementing these programmes. In a country as large as India, now
                with 28 states and eight union territories, this has created vast differences between states in terms of
                their policies, plans, programmes and initiatives relating to school education. Periodically, national
                policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and policies.
                State governments and local government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools
                and the number of government-managed elementary schools is growing. Simultaneously the number and
                proportion managed by private bodies is growing. In 2005-6 83.13% of schools offering elementary
                education (Grades 1–8) were managed by government and 16.86% of schools were under private management
                (excluding children in unrecognised schools, schools established under the Education Guarantee Scheme
                and in alternative learning centers). Of those schools managed privately, one third are 'aided' and two
                thirds are 'unaided'. Enrolment in Grades 1–8 is shared between government and privately managed schools
                in the ratio 73:27. However in rural areas this ratio is higher (80:20) and in urban areas much lower
                (36:66).
